  <summary>📝 Bio</summary>
  <br>
  
  I'm just your average high school developer. Ok, maybe not. I'm a self taught developer, and I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Nodejs, Npmjs, Vuejs and Nuxtjs. I've hosted Desica's iDesign podcast, and am founder of [Desica](https://desica.uk). I even have my own themed version of bootstrap, [Desikit](https://npmjs.com/desikit).

  <summary>😍 Loving my README?</summary>
  <br>
  
  I used [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io/), which I found out about from [@micahlt](https://github.com/micahlt). I made my badge in [Figma](https://figma.com/), and, that's about it.
